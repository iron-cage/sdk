## Questions Answered

### "Why didn't we rename any crates?"

Full answer in `/insights/-CRATE_NAMING_EXPLANATION.md`

**Summary:** You explicitly told us to keep iron_* crate names. We implemented two-layer naming:
- Technical layer: iron_control (preserved)
- User layer: Control Panel (updated)
- Result: Zero code changes, 100% user improvement

This could become a LinkedIn post about thoughtful engineering decisions.
