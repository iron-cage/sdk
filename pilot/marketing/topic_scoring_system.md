# Content Topic Scoring System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Purpose:** Objective framework to prioritize content topics before creation

---

## The Core Problem

**90% of content fails because topics are chosen by:**
- Gut feeling ("I think this is interesting")
- Vanity ("This sounds impressive")
- Imitation ("Competitor wrote about it")

**Result:** High effort, low conversion, wasted time.

**Solution:** Score topics objectively. Only create high-scoring topics.

---

## The Scoring Formula

### Five Criteria (Rate 1-5 Each)

| Criterion | Weight | Question | 1 = Low | 5 = High |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Buyer Impact** | 3x | Does this move deals forward? | Nice-to-know | Removes buying objection |
| **Signal Strength** | 2x | How many channels saw this? | 1 source | 4+ sources |
| **Differentiation** | 2x | Is our take unique? | Competitors cover well | Greenfield/10x better |
| **Urgency** | 1x | Is this urgent? | Someday problem | Hair on fire (deadline) |
| **Feasibility** | 1x | Can we create this? | No data/expertise | Have data + expertise |

**Total Score = (Buyer Impact × 3) + (Signal Strength × 2) + (Differentiation × 2) + Urgency + Feasibility**

**Maximum:** 60 points

---

## Decision Thresholds

| Score | % | Decision | Action |
|-------|---|----------|--------|
| **50-60** | 83-100% | ✅ CREATE THIS WEEK | Validated winner, high confidence |
| **40-49** | 67-82% | ✅ CREATE THIS MONTH | Solid topic, good signal |
| **30-39** | 50-66% | ⏸️ VALIDATE FIRST | Run LinkedIn poll, need more data |
| **20-29** | 33-49% | ❌ BACKLOG | Weak signal, low priority |
| **<20** | <33% | ❌ DISCARD | Don't waste time |

**Rule:** Never create content scoring <40 without additional validation.

---

## Signal Sources (Evidence Required)

### Count These as Signals

**Direct buyer feedback:**
- ✅ Sales call mentions (1 mention = 1 signal)
- ✅ Support ticket patterns (5+ tickets same topic = 1 signal)
- ✅ Customer onboarding friction (documented struggle = 1 signal)

**Market validation:**
- ✅ LinkedIn poll results (50+ votes = 1 signal)
- ✅ Competitor content gap (3+ competitors ignore it = 1 signal)
- ✅ SEO search volume (100+ searches/month = 1 signal)

**Community patterns:**
- ✅ Reddit/HN thread (50+ upvotes = 1 signal)
- ✅ Discord recurring question (3+ times in 30 days = 1 signal)

**Signal Strength Scoring:**
- 1 signal = Score 1
- 2 signals = Score 2
- 3 signals = Score 3
- 4 signals = Score 4
- 5+ signals = Score 5

## Scoring Template (Copy This Weekly)

### Topic: [TOPIC NAME]

**Date Scored:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

#### 1. Buyer Impact (1-5) × 3

**Which persona does this serve?**
- [ ] Alex (Enterprise CTO) - Removes buying objection?
- [ ] Sarah (SMB Founder) - Solves urgent pain?
- [ ] Marcus (VP Eng) - Helps them recommend us?
- [ ] Elena (Developer) - Builds credibility?

**Does this move deals forward?**
- 5 = Directly removes buying objection (e.g., SOC 2 compliance blocking purchase)
- 4 = Addresses top-3 pain point (e.g., cost unpredictability)
- 3 = Relevant to buying decision (e.g., integration complexity)
- 2 = Interesting but not critical (e.g., performance optimization)
- 1 = Nice-to-know (e.g., company culture)

**Score:** ___/5 × 3 = ___/15 points

#### 2. Signal Strength (1-5) × 2

**List evidence (sources):**
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________

**Count signals:** ___

**Score:** ___/5 × 2 = ___/10 points

#### 3. Differentiation (1-5) × 2

**Competitor coverage:**
- Competitor A: [ ] Not covered [ ] Shallow [ ] Deep
- Competitor B: [ ] Not covered [ ] Shallow [ ] Deep
- Competitor C: [ ] Not covered [ ] Shallow [ ] Deep

**Our angle:**
- 5 = Greenfield (nobody covers this) OR 10x better unique data
- 4 = Most cover poorly, we can dominate
- 3 = Some cover well, but we have unique angle
- 2 = Well-covered, but we add incremental value
- 1 = Saturated, can't differentiate

**Score:** ___/5 × 2 = ___/10 points

#### 4. Urgency (1-5) × 1

**Time sensitivity:**
- 5 = Deadline-driven (SOC 2 audit in 60 days, conference next week)
- 4 = Acute pain (happening right now, costing money daily)
- 3 = Recurring pain (happens monthly/quarterly)
- 2 = Chronic pain (always present, not urgent)
- 1 = Aspirational (nice to solve someday)

**Score:** ___/5 × 1 = ___/5 points

#### 5. Feasibility (1-5) × 1

**Can we create this credibly?**
- 5 = Have first-hand data + expertise (we solved this problem ourselves)
- 4 = Have customer case study + access to experts
- 3 = Have research + can interview 2-3 sources
- 2 = Can research but no unique data
- 1 = Don't have expertise or data

**Score:** ___/5 × 1 = ___/5 points

## Example: "How to Pass SOC 2 Audit with AI Agents"

**Date Scored:** 2025-12-03

#### 1. Buyer Impact: 5/5 × 3 = 15 points

**Persona:** Alex (Enterprise CTO)
**Why:** Alex said "compliance is blocking deployment" in 3/5 sales calls. This directly removes buying objection.

#### 2. Signal Strength: 4/5 × 2 = 8 points

**Sources:**
1. Sales calls: 8/10 prospects mentioned SOC 2 challenges
2. LinkedIn poll: 31% voted "data privacy/compliance" (39 votes)
3. Support tickets: 6 tickets about audit logs in last 30 days
4. Competitor gap: None of 3 main competitors cover this

**Count:** 4 signals

#### 3. Differentiation: 5/5 × 2 = 10 points

**Competitor coverage:**
- Competitor A: Not covered
- Competitor B: Generic "security best practices" (shallow)
- Competitor C: Not covered

**Our angle:** Specific SOC 2 audit checklist based on pilot customer who passed audit. Greenfield opportunity.

#### 4. Urgency: 5/5 × 1 = 5 points

**Why:** "We have SOC 2 audit in 60 days" (actual quote from 2 prospects). Deadline-driven pain.

#### 5. Feasibility: 4/5 × 1 = 4 points

**Data available:**
- Interviewed pilot customer who passed SOC 2 with Iron Cage
- Have their actual audit checklist
- Can document specific requirements auditors checked

---

### TOTAL: 42/60 (70%)

**Decision:** ✅ Create this month (solid signal, validated topic)

**Created:** Week 2, published as gated PDF
**Results:** 187 downloads, 12 discovery calls, 2 pilot contracts ($32K MRR)
**ROI:** 20 hours → $32K MRR = $1,600/hour

## Performance Tracking (Update Monthly)

### Month: [MONTH YEAR]

| Topic | Score | Persona | Impressions | CTR | Calls | Deals | MRR | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-----|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| [Topic 1] | 52 | Alex | 8,200 | 3.2% | 7 | 1 | $12K | War stories work |
| [Topic 2] | 48 | Alex | 12,400 | 5.1% | 12 | 2 | $32K | Gated PDF = high conv |
| [Topic 3] | 38 | Elena | 15,600 | 2.1% | 3 | 0 | $0 | Dev audience ≠ buyers |
| [Topic 4] | 42 | Marcus | 6,100 | 1.8% | 2 | 0 | $0 | Too technical |

### Learnings (Recalibrate Scoring)

**What worked:**
- Gated checklists/guides → Add +3 to Buyer Impact for "checklist" format
- War stories with $ amounts → Add +2 to Buyer Impact for "cost failure" topics
- Enterprise compliance topics → Add +2 to Urgency for "audit deadline" topics

**What failed:**
- Technical deep-dives for Elena → Subtract -3 from Buyer Impact (unless bottom-up goal)
- Generic "how-to" content → Subtract -2 from Differentiation (need unique angle)

**Scoring adjustments for next month:**
- Checklist format: Buyer Impact +3
- War story format: Buyer Impact +2
- Audit deadline urgency: Urgency +2
- Elena-targeted technical: Buyer Impact -3
- Generic how-to: Differentiation -2

## Weekly Workflow

### Monday (1 hour): Collect Signals

1. Review last week's sales calls (30 min)
   - Note pain points, questions, objections
   - Count mentions by topic

2. Review support tickets (15 min)
   - Count tickets by topic category
   - Flag topics with 5+ tickets

3. Scan community (15 min)
   - HackerNews, Reddit, Discord
   - Note threads with 50+ upvotes/comments

**Output:** List of 10-15 potential topics with signal sources

---

### Tuesday (30 min): Score & Prioritize

1. Cluster similar topics (10 min)
   - "Cost overruns" + "surprise bills" + "budget limits" = one topic

2. Score top 3-5 clusters (20 min)
   - Use scoring template above
   - Calculate total scores
   - Rank by score

**Output:** Ranked list of 3-5 scored topics

---

### Tuesday 8am EST (30 min): Validate #1 Topic

If top topic scores 30-49 (needs validation):
- Post LinkedIn poll
- Run for 3 days
- Analyze Friday

If top topic scores 50+ (validated):
- Skip poll, start creating

---

### Friday (30 min): Analyze & Decide

Review poll results (if ran poll):
- 50+ votes + 5+ quality comments = Bump score +10, CREATE
- 30-49 votes + 2-4 comments = Keep score, CREATE THIS MONTH
- <30 votes + <2 comments = Subtract -10, DISCARD

**Output:** Final decision on next week's content topic

---

## Decision Rules (No Exceptions)

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Score topics before creating (no guessing)
- ✅ Document signal sources (evidence required)
- ✅ Track performance monthly (learn what works)
- ✅ Recalibrate scoring quarterly (improve system)

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Create content scoring <40 without LinkedIn poll validation
- ❌ Create content with <2 signal sources (too weak)
- ❌ Skip scoring because "this feels important" (objectivity > intuition)
- ❌ Ignore performance data (if it scored high but failed, recalibrate)

---

## Summary: The System in 3 Steps

**1. SCORE (Tuesday, 30 min)**
```
Use template above → Calculate total score → Check threshold
```

**2. VALIDATE (Tuesday 8am, if score 30-49)**
```
Post LinkedIn poll → Wait 3 days → Analyze results
```

**3. DECIDE (Friday, 5 min)**
```
50-60 points = Create this week
40-49 points = Create this month
30-39 points = Validate first (poll)
<30 points = Discard
```

**Time investment:** 2.5 hours/week
**Output:** 1 validated, high-confidence topic/week
**Result:** 60-80% hit rate vs 10% hit rate from guessing
