# Environment configuration for integration tests
#
# Phase 2 Week 4 Day 20: Real API integration testing
#
# Per plan: "Tests must use real OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API keys (from environment)"
# Per plan: "Tests must make actual API calls (small, cheap requests)"
# Per plan: "Tests must fail loudly if API keys missing (never skip/ignore)"
#
# Copy this file to .env.test and fill in your API keys

# OpenAI API Key (required for api_openai integration tests)
# Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Anthropic API Key (required for api_claude integration tests)
# Get from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Google Gemini API Key (required for api_gemini integration tests)
# Get from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# Test database URL (optional - defaults to in-memory SQLite)
TEST_DATABASE_URL=sqlite::memory:

# Notes:
# - Integration tests make REAL API calls (cost: ~$0.001 per test run)
# - Tests use small requests to minimize cost (e.g., "Say 'test' only")
# - If API keys are missing, tests will FAIL LOUDLY (not skip/ignore)
# - This follows the "no mocks" policy from the implementation plan
