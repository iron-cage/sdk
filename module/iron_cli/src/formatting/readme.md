# Directory: formatting

## Responsibility Table

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| formatter.rs | Implements output formatting for all formats |
| mod.rs | Exports formatting module public API |
| output_format.rs | Defines output format enum and parsing |

## Validation

One-Second Test: Scan the Responsibility column - if any two entries sound similar, they overlap and must be reconsolidated.
