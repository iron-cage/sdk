## Responsibility Table

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| builder.rs | Provides fluent API for test database creation |
| error.rs | Defines test database error types |
| lib.rs | Exports test database module public API |
| migrations.rs | Manages database migration state |
| wipe.rs | Automatically wipes tables with dependency detection |

## Validation

One-Second Test: Scan the Responsibility column - if any two entries sound similar, they overlap and must be reconsolidated.
