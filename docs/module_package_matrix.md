# Module-to-Package Mapping Matrix

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Status:** Active - Two Repository Architecture
**Repository:** iron_runtime (this document exists in both iron_runtime and iron_cage repositories)

---

> **📍 Note:** You are viewing from the **iron_runtime** repository. This matrix shows all 22 modules across both repositories. Iron_runtime contains 12 modules; iron_cage contains 10 modules (including 3 foundation modules published to crates.io).

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Two-Repository Architecture

As of December 2025, Iron Cage transitioned from a single monorepo to a **two-repository architecture**:

1. **iron_runtime** (this repository) - Control Panel, Agent Runtime, runtime services (12 modules)
2. **iron_cage** (separate repository) - OS sandboxing, CLI tools, foundation modules (10 modules)

**This document describes the module-to-package mapping across BOTH repositories.**

**Module Distribution:**
- **9 modules moved to iron_runtime**: iron_state, iron_safety, iron_reliability, iron_secrets, iron_token_manager, iron_lang, iron_api, iron_runtime, (+ iron_dashboard Vue app, + Python packages)
- **10 modules remain in iron_cage**: iron_sandbox_core, iron_sandbox, iron_types, iron_cost, iron_telemetry, iron_cli, iron_site, iron_cli_py, iron_sandbox_py, iron_testing

**Repository Communication:** iron_runtime and iron_cage communicate via crates.io (shared foundation modules) and HTTPS API (telemetry, optional).

**See:** `repository_architecture.md` for complete two-repository documentation.

---

## Scope

**Responsibility:** Maps all 22 modules across both repositories to their deployment packages showing which modules are included in each package

**In Scope:**
- Module-to-package mapping matrix (22 modules × 6 packages)
- Repository distribution (which modules in iron_runtime vs iron_cage)
- Shared module identification (modules appearing in multiple packages)
- Module reuse pattern analysis
- Foundation module distribution across packages and repositories
- Package composition statistics
- Quick reference lookup (which package contains module X, which repository)

**Out of Scope:**
- Two-repository architecture design (see `repository_architecture.md`)
- Package definitions and characteristics (see `deployment_packages.md`)
- Package-to-package dependencies (see `package_dependencies.md`)
- Module implementation details (see `module/*/spec.md` in respective repository)
- Build and compilation processes (see respective repository CI/CD)
- Module architecture and layering (see `readme.md` § Architecture in respective repository)

---

## Deployment Modes

Iron Cage supports two deployment modes with different module-to-package mappings:

### Pilot/Demo Mode (Single Process, Localhost)

**Use Case:** Conference demos, local development, single-user testing

**Deployment:** All modules run in single Rust process on localhost. Dashboard connects via WebSocket.

**Module Sharing:** iron_state is shared instance accessed by both iron_runtime and iron_api in same process.

**Package Structure:**
- Combined "Iron Cage Pilot" package
- Includes: iron_runtime, iron_api, iron_dashboard, iron_state (all modules)
- Deployment: Single binary + static UI files
- Communication: WebSocket (localhost:8080)

**Data Flow:**
```
Agent Event → iron_runtime
                ↓
         iron_state.save_agent_state()
                ↓
         broadcast StateUpdate
                ↓
           iron_api/ws
                ↓
         Dashboard UI
```

**Pilot Mode Package Composition:**
- All 21 modules compiled into single binary
- iron_state shared between iron_runtime and iron_api
- Single SQLite database (./iron_state.db)

---

### Production Mode (Distributed, Cloud + Local)

**Use Case:** Multi-user SaaS, enterprise deployments, agents on developer machines

**Deployment:** Control Panel runs on cloud (AWS/GCP), Agent Runtime runs on developer machines.

**Module Separation:** Control Panel and Agent Runtime have completely separate data models and databases.

**Package Structure:**

**Control Panel Package (Docker, cloud):**
- Modules: iron_api, iron_dashboard, iron_token_manager, iron_secrets, **iron_control_store**
- Database: PostgreSQL (users, tokens, secrets, telemetry)
- **NO iron_state** (doesn't track agent execution)
- Receives telemetry from distributed agents via HTTPS POST

**Agent Runtime Package (PyPI, local install):**
- Modules: iron_runtime, iron_sdk, iron_state, iron_safety, iron_cost
- Database: SQLite (local agent state, audit events per machine)
- Sends telemetry to Control Panel via HTTPS (optional)

**Data Flow:**
```
Cloud: Control Panel                Developer Machines
├── iron_api                         ├── Machine 1: Alice
│   └── iron_control_store           │   ├── iron_runtime
│       └── PostgreSQL               │   └── iron_state → SQLite
│           (users, tokens,          │
│            telemetry)               ├── Machine 2: Bob
│                                     │   ├── iron_runtime
│   ▲                                 │   └── iron_state → SQLite
│   │ HTTPS POST /api/telemetry      │
│   └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Difference:** Control Panel does NOT have iron_state in production mode. It uses iron_control_store for user/token/secrets data.

---

### Current Status

**Pilot Implementation (Dec 2025):** Uses Pilot/Demo Mode only
**Production Implementation:** Planned post-pilot (Q1 2026)

**This document shows Production Mode mappings unless otherwise noted.**

## Overview

This document provides the definitive mapping between Iron Cage's 22 modules (across **two repositories**) and 6 deployment packages. Use this as a quick reference to answer questions like:

- "Which repository contains `iron_api`?" (Answer: iron_runtime)
- "Which package contains `iron_sdk`?" (Answer: Agent Runtime)
- "What modules are in the Agent Runtime package?"
- "Which modules are shared across multiple packages?"
- "How many modules does each package contain?"

**Quick Stats:**
- **22 total modules** across **2 repositories** and **6 deployment packages**
- **iron_runtime repository**: 12 modules (9 Rust + 1 Vue + 2 Python)
- **iron_cage repository**: 10 modules (6 Rust + 1 Vue + 3 Python)
- **3 foundation modules** published to crates.io (shared between repositories)
- **Package sizes:** 1-11 modules per package

## Shared Module Analysis

### Deployment Mode Impact

**Pilot Mode (Single Process):**
In pilot mode, these modules are **shared within same process**:

| Module         | Shared By                     | Mechanism           |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| iron_state     | iron_runtime + iron_api       | Arc<StateManager>   |
| iron_types     | All modules                   | Compile-time types  |
| iron_telemetry | All modules                   | Global logger       |

**Production Mode (Distributed):**
In production mode, these modules are **compiled separately** (no sharing):

| Module             | Packages                     | Count | Sharing |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-------|---------|
| iron_cost          | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | NO      |
| iron_telemetry     | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | NO      |
| iron_types         | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | NO      |
| iron_control_store | Control Panel only           | 1     | N/A     |
| iron_state         | Agent Runtime only           | 1     | N/A     |

**Key Point:** In production, Control Panel and Agent Runtime run on DIFFERENT MACHINES with DIFFERENT DATABASES. No module sharing occurs.

---

### Modules Appearing in Multiple Packages (Production Mode)

These foundation modules are compiled/bundled separately for each package:

| Module           | Packages                     | Count | Usage Pattern              |
|------------------|------------------------------|-------|----------------------------|
| iron_cost        | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | Budget tracking foundation |
| iron_telemetry   | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | Logging foundation         |
| iron_types       | Control Panel, Agent Runtime | 2     | Foundation types           |

**Key Observations:**
- **3 shared modules** appear in both Control Panel and Agent Runtime (production mode)
- **No module appears in all 6 packages**
- **Shared modules are foundation only** (types, telemetry, cost)
- **Application modules are exclusive** (CLI, SDK, Dashboard, etc.)
- **iron_state is NOT shared** in production mode (Agent Runtime only)

---

## Module Reuse Patterns

### Pattern 1: Foundation Module Sharing

**Modules:** iron_types, iron_state, iron_telemetry, iron_cost

**Shared Between:** Control Panel ↔ Agent Runtime

**Rationale:**
- Both packages need logging (iron_telemetry)
- Both packages need state management (iron_state)
- Both packages share common types (iron_types)
- Both packages track costs (iron_cost)

**Implementation:** Compiled separately for each package (no shared library)

---

### Pattern 2: Exclusive Application Modules

**Modules:** iron_api, iron_dashboard, iron_cli, iron_cli_py, iron_sdk, iron_examples, iron_testing, iron_site

**Characteristics:**
- Each appears in exactly one package
- Application-level functionality
- Not reused across packages

---

### Pattern 3: Technology-Specific Modules

**Python Modules:** iron_sdk, iron_examples, iron_testing, iron_cli_py, iron_sandbox_py
- Distributed via PyPI
- Grouped in Runtime/Sandbox/Python CLI packages

**Rust Modules:** iron_*, iron_*_core (majority)
- Compiled into binaries or .so files
- Foundation and core logic

**TypeScript Modules:** iron_dashboard, iron_site
- Bundled with Vite
- Web applications

---

## Package Statistics

| Package        | Modules | Rust | Python | TypeScript | Shared Modules |
|----------------|---------|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Control Panel  | 8       | 7    | 0      | 1          | 4              |
| Marketing Site | 1       | 0    | 0      | 1          | 0              |
| Agent Runtime  | 11      | 8    | 3      | 0          | 4              |
| Sandbox        | 3       | 2    | 1      | 0          | 0              |
| CLI Tool       | 1       | 1    | 0      | 0          | 0              |
| Python CLI     | 1       | 0    | 1      | 0          | 0              |
| **Total**      | **25*** | **18**| **5**  | **2**      | **4**          |

\* Total is 25 (not 21) because 4 modules appear in 2 packages each: 21 + 4 = 25
