# Protocol 009: Reserved

**Status:** Archived
**Version:** 0.0.0

## Status

This protocol number (009) is **reserved** and intentionally left unused.

**Reason:** Organizational gap in numbering system - no protocol was assigned to this number during initial documentation phase.

**Future Use:** This number may be assigned to a future protocol if needed, or may remain reserved indefinitely to maintain continuity with existing numbering.

## Numbering System

The protocol directory uses a structured numbering system:

- **001:** Archived (IronLang Data Protocol - legacy, see `-archived_-archived_001_ironlang_data_protocol.md`)
- **002-008:** Core protocols (REST, WebSocket, Budget Control, Token Management, Authentication, User Management)
- **009:** Reserved (this file)
- **010+:** Feature APIs (Agents, Providers, Analytics, Budget Limits, API Tokens, Projects, Settings, Budget Requests)
