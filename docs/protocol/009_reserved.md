## Status

This protocol number (009) is **reserved** and intentionally left unused.

**Reason:** Organizational gap in numbering system - no protocol was assigned to this number during initial documentation phase.

**Future Use:** This number may be assigned to a future protocol if needed, or may remain reserved indefinitely to maintain continuity with existing numbering.

## Numbering System

- **009:** Reserved (this file)
- **010+:** Feature APIs (Agents, Providers, Analytics, Budget Limits, API Tokens, Projects, Settings, Budget Requests)
